New in version Fedora3.

This option corresponds to the Firewall Configuration screen in the installation program

optional arguments:

--disable, --disabled

Do not configure any iptables rules.

New in version Fedora3.

--enable, --enabled

Reject incoming connections that are not in response to outbound requests, such as DNS replies or DHCP requests. If access to services running on this machine is needed, you can choose to allow specific services through the firewall.

--port PORTS

You can specify that ports be allowed through the firewall using the port:protocol format. You can also specify ports numerically. Multiple ports can be combined into one option as long as they are separated by commas. For example:

``firewall --port=imap:tcp,1234:ucp,47``
New in version Fedora3.

--trust TRUSTS

Listing a device here, such as eth0, allows all traffic coming from that device to go through the firewall. To list more than one device, use –trust eth0 –trust eth1. Do NOT use a comma-separated format such as –trust eth0, eth1.

New in version Fedora3.

--service SERVICES

This option provides a higher-level way to allow services through the firewall. Some services (like cups, avahi, etc.) require multiple ports to be open or other special configuration in order for the service to work. You could specify each individual service with the --port option, or specify --service= and open them all at once.

Valid options are anything recognized by the firewall-cmd program in the firewalld package. If firewalld is running:

``firewall-cmd --get-services``
will provide a list of known service names.

New in version Fedora10.

--use-system-defaults

Don’t configure the firewall at all. This instructs anaconda to do nothing and allows the system to rely on the defaults that were provided with the package or ostree. If this option is used with other options then all other options will be ignored.

New in version Fedora28.
