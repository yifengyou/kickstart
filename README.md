## kickstart介绍

```
Many system administrators would prefer to use an automated installation method
to install Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux on their machines.
To answer this need, Red Hat created the kickstart installation method.
Using kickstart, a system administrator can create a single file containing the
answers to all the questions that would normally be asked during a typical installation.

Kickstart files can be kept on a server system and read by individual computers
during the installation. This installation method can support the use of a
single kickstart file to install Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux on multiple
machines, making it ideal for network and system administrators.
